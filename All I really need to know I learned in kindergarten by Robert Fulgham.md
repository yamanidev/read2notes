"We thought you would never learn how or when to ask anyone for help. How can you be a minister, be in the profession of helping others, if you don't know what it's like to need help yourself? Now you know how it feels to have to ask."
"We will help you. You are worth helping. And before I go on, think about how you felt when I said that."
