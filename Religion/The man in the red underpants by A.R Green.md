## Chapter 1: The journey begins

*Your mobile phone is composed of a few basic elements. Plastic, glass, silicon for the chip, and some precious metals. Plastic comes from oil, and glass and silicon comes from sand. So basically what you're holding in your hand is oil and sand. Now what if I told you that I was walking along in the desert of Arabia (lots of oil and sand) and picked up a mobile phone which I found lying there... a product of billions of years of random events? The wind blew, the sun shone, the rain fell, lightning struck, the oil bubbled, the camel trod and after millions and millions of years the mobile phone formed itself. And naturally I picked it up, push the call button... "Hi, Mom!"*

*Is there a chance that this could have randomly formed itself through natural processes? However remotely possible, most of us would simply not accept this as a reasonable explanation.*

*Why then would we acept such an explanation for our universe and the life within it? Even if we accept evolution as a process, the idea that life evolved merely as a series of random events is difficult to acept as a reasonable explanation*... *At least the theory of evolution attempts to offer some explanation of how this might have happened, but the idea that the universe is a product of some random events has no comparable explanation, and the laws, systems and forms taht shape the universe are actually much more complex that those that govern biological life.*

Ad infinitum: latin phrase meaning to infinity.

Since there's clearly intelligence and will that designed and created the universe, the natural question to ask is who created this intelligence? The author gives an example of a sniper that's waiting for the order to shoot and communicates with HQ, which in turn communicates with the higher manager and so on and so forth.

*We can't have creators creating creators forever, or else, just as the sniper will never shoot, the creation will never get created. But the creation is here. It exists. So we can dismiss the idea of an infinite regression of causes as being an irrational proposition.
So what's the alternative? The alternative is the first cause/ An uncaused cause!*

## Chapter 2: Unanswered questions
*As an example, imagine someone took you to a strange building. You're standing at the closed front door, and that person asks you, "What's behind that door, inside the building?" How much could you know through reason? You might be able to guess some things, like perhaps there being tables and chairs and lights and taps... but you could be wrong. It could be completely empty, or completely full or well, almost anything. So how could you know, how could you reach certainty about what is behind that door? Well of course you could go in and see with your won eyes, but what if that was not possible? How, then could you come to know what is inside?*

*Well, one way is that someone who has been inside tells you, or even a person who knows someone who has been inside tells you. But the question here is, how can I trust this man? How can I be sure that woman is telling the truth?*

The author here presents the analogy to the questions we ask about our existence, why is there evil, why are we here... Such questions cannot be answered rightfully with logic. Just as you cannot know what's behind the door. We would require reason to verify the authenticity of the person we're asking though.

## Chapter 4: The test of character
*The orientalist Richard Burton writes that the Qur’an we have today is ‘the text which has come down to us in the form in which it was organized and approved by the Prophet…What we have today in our hands is the mushaf \[text] of Muhammad.’ Kenneth Cragg describes the transmission of the Qur’an from the time of revelation to today as occurring in ‘an unbroken living sequence of devotion.’ Schwally writes in Geschichte des Qorans that ‘As far as the various pieces of revelation are concerned, we may be confident that their text has been generally transmitted exactly as it was found in the Prophet’s legacy’.*

oration is a formal speech. An orator is also said to be an eloquent and skilled speaker.

a polemic is a controversy, argument or refutation.

to dissent is to disagree.

## Chapter 5: Amazing level of information
At the time of the prophet Mohamed pbuh, there was no Arabic Bible. So the argument that says Mohamed pbuh copied what was in the Bible, is nonsensical.

*It is interesting how Joseph (son of Israel or Jacob) also mentioned in the Quran, never refers to the ruler of Egypt as Pharaoh but rather calls him King, whereas Moses is clearly dealing with a Pharaoh. The Bible calls both Pharaoh. Not such a problem one might think, except that when we try to locate Joseph in history we find that the dynasty ruling Egypt at the time were in fact the Hykos, who were Semites and didn’t use the term Pharaoh, which
was a term used by the native Egyptians for their rulers. The ruler of Egypt under Moses was a native Egyptian who had supplanted the Hykos and who began to oppress the tribe of Israel. If Mohammed had copied the Bible, why didn’t he copy this historical error? And where did he get such accurate information from? There were no universities with departments of Egyptology at that time. The knowledge of reading hieroglyphs had been lost hundreds of years previously, and was not known again until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone 1000 years later*

a dynasty is a ruling family.

*Dr. Maurice Bucaille was one of the first people to study the name Haman from an Egyptological view point. He surmised that since ‘Haman’ was mentioned in the Qur’an during the time of Moses in Egypt, the best course of action was to ask an expert in the old
Egyptian language, i.e., hieroglyphs, regarding the name. Bucaille narrates an interesting discussion he had with a prominent French Egyptologist:*

*“In the book Reflections on the Qur’an (Réflexions sur le Coran), I have related the result of such a consultation that dates back to a dozen years ago and led me to question a specialist who, in addition, knew the classical Arabic language well. One of the most
prominent French Egyptologists, fulfilling these conditions, was kind enough to answer the question. I showed him the word ‘Haman’ that I had copied exactly how it is written in the Qur’an, and told him that it had been extracted from a sentence of a document dating back to the 7th century AD, the sentence being related to somebody connected with Egyptian
history. He said to me that, in such a case, he would see in this word the transliteration of a hieroglyphic name but, for him, undoubtedly it could not be possible that a written document of the 7th century had contained a hieroglyphic name - unknown until that time
since, in that time, the hieroglyphs had been totally forgotten.*

*In order to confirm his deduction about the name, he advised me to consult the Dictionary of Personal Names of the New Kingdom by Ranke, where I might find the name written in hieroglyphs, as he had written before me, and the transliteration in German. I discovered all that had been presumed by the expert, and, moreover, I was stupefied to read the profession of Haman: ‘The Chief of the workers in the stone-quarries,’ exactly what could be deduced from the Qur’an, though the words of the Pharaoh suggest a master of construction.*

*When I came again to the expert with a photocopy of the page of the Dictionary concerning ‘Haman’ and showed him one of the pages of the Qur’an where he could read the name, he was speechless...*

*Moreover, Ranke had noted, as a reference, a book published in 1906 by the Egyptologist Walter Wreszinski: the latter had mentioned that the name of ‘Haman’ had been engraved on a stela kept at the Hof-Museum of Vienna (Austria). Several years later, when I was able to read the profession written in hieroglyphs on the stela, I observed that the determinative joined to the name had emphasised the importance of the intimate relationship to the Pharaoh.”*

“And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all \[heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.”
\[The Quran; Chapter 21 - The Prophets, Verse 33]

Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University Mustansir Mir says about this verse:
“The word yasbaḥūna (swim or float) made good sense to seventh century Arabs observing natural phenomena with the naked eye; it is equally meaningful to us in light of today’s scientific findings \[i.e. celestial mechanics].”
How can the same text make sense to completely different people at completely different times and places.

*Keith Moore, professor emeritus in the division of anatomy, in the Faculty of Surgery, at the University of Toronto, and was the world’s leading embryologist, said concerning these statements in the Quran and authenticated hadeeth:
“Until the 19th Century, nothing was known about classifying the stages of human development. A system of staging human embryos was developed around the end of the 19th Century based on alphabetical symbols. During the 20th century, numerals were used to describe 23 stages of embryonic development. This system of numbering the stages is not easy to follow and a better system would be based on the morphological changes. In recent years, the study of the Qur’an has revealed another basis for the classification of the
stages of the developing embryo which is based on easily understood actions and changes in shape. It utilises terms which were sent from God to Muhammed the Prophet by the Angel Gabriel and recorded on the Qur’an... It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammed from God because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammed must have been a Messenger of God.”*
