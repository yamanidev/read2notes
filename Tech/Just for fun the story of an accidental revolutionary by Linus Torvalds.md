*Instead of tinkering under the metaphoric hoods of their computers, kids these days are playing too many games, and losing their minds. Not that there's anything wrong with games. They were some of my earliest programs.*

*People respect each other's privacy in Finland, so nobody would think of going up to a stranger and striking up a conversation.*

*Finns are actually quite friendly. But few people are ever able to find that out.*

*The country has a history of being quick and confident in the adoption of technology. For example, unlike practically everywhere else on Earth, Finland is a place where folks routinely pay bills and conduct all their banking electronically*

*There are more internet nodes per capita in Finland than any other country.*

*Finland has the highest literacy rate, and university tuition is free*

*Lack a project and you lack enthusiasm.*

*An ugly system is one in which there are special interfaces for everything you want to do. Unix is the opposite. It gives you the building blocks that are sufficient for doing everything. That's what having a clean design is all about.*

*Unix, on the other hand, comes with a small-is-beautiful philosophy. It has a small set of simple basic building blocks that can be combined into something that allows for infinite complexity of expression.*

*Like so many other things in computers, it was all about games. It took somebody who wanted to play computer games on a PDP-11. Because that was what UNIX started out being developed for -Dennis and Ken's personal projects for playing Space Wars.*

*What makes programming so engaging is that, while you can make the computer do what you want, you have to figure out how.*

*Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you
Be proud of what you do
And have fun doing it*

About Richard Stallman:
*The way I understand it, his motivation for promoting open source was not so much anticommercial as it was antiexclusion. For him, open source is about not getting left out. It's about being able to continue working on a project regardless of who makes it commercial.*
