*Every 15min job now ends up taking an hour.* - Michael Dirda's father

*Just remember though: keep trying books outside your comfort zone. At least from time to time. True readers boldly go where they haven't gone before.*

*Books don't just furnish a room. A personal library is a reflection of who you are and who you want to be, of what you value and what you desire, of how much you know and much more you'd like to know.*
